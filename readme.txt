1) Open VS Code Integrated terminal and type ./zhour.sh on the command line
   (To open vscode integrated terminal on the menubar choose View and than Terminal)
2) Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8088 to display the website

N.B: I included a simple html file for testing

3) Write your php pages as you would in a WAMP installation on windows
4) whatever you write on your working directory will be reflected in the container
5 You could also create sub directories in your working directory like you would for any
  any website. for images, css or javascript for example.
  all these sub directories will be accessible by your running container
