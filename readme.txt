Read the docker-compose.yml comments carefully.

These comments explain what docker compose does behind the scene.

Your are invited to consult docker's documents and recreate the same environnement 
using simple docker commands. meaning creating docker volume, docker network 
and launching the containers with environnements variables and 
mounting volumes and linking the containers in the same network.


I am not gonna do it for you. This is your homework lol
